<h1>FAQ</h1>

<h3>What is that "ratio" for games?</h3>
<p>
  "Ratio" is the relation between viewers and channels. It is the calculated average number of viewers per channel.
</p>

<h3>How often is data collected?</h3>
<p>
  Data is collected once an hour from the twitch API. For performance reasons only statistics for the last month are displayed hourly. Later statistics
  use daily or monthly precision.
</p>

<h3>Why is the data on the game and channel list not identical to the data on twitch.tv?</h3>
<p>
  As data for TTV Stats is collected once every hour the game and channel list displays the most recent collected data. This data can be up to an hour old.
  Both lists could use live data from Twitch but then no sorting or filtering would be possible.
</p>

<h3>Why are not all channels listed and how are listed channels selected?</h3>
<p>
  Because Twitch has a very large amount of channels (much higher than games) not all of them are listed. Data is only gathered for channels with a minimum of 1,000,000 views.
  Also the channel has to be in the top 1,000 channels at the time of collection. This criteria might change later.
