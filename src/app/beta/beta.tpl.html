<h1>Beta</h1>

<p>
  This project is currently in a beta phase which means that it some bugs might occure. Also browser support might
  not be perfect for all available browsers. Bugs can be reportet via the <a ui-sref="about">contact information</a>
  or by using the public trello board.

<p>
  The beta status also means that not all planned features are currently implemented and that the site is still under
  frequent development. There are a lot more features planned to be added and feature requests are very welcome.
